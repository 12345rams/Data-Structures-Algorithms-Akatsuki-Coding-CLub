## Contributing to this Repo

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/Google-Developer-Student-Club-CCOEW/Competitive-Programming-2023/fork) repository.

2. Clone the forked repository.

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/project_name.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory.

***bash***
```
cd Problems
```

4. Creating a new branch (IMP) 🌱
   
This is one of the very important steps that you should follow to contribute to Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not create a mess. To create a new branch:

***bash***
```
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

***bash***
```
git pull origin main
```

5. Make changes in source code. 🚀

6. Stage your changes and commit 📝

***bash***

**Add changes to Index**
```
git add .
```

**Commit to the local repo**
```
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

7. At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

***bash***
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```
